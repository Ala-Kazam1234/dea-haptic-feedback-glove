# Dielectric Elastomer Actuator Haptic Feedback Glove
Compact dielectric elastomer actuators for haptic feedback in a wearable glove

This repository documents the design and prototyping of compact dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) for use in a wearable haptic feedback glove. The system is intended for robotic teleoperation and imitation learning, providing localized tactile feedback through lightweight, compliant actuators.

The work highlights end-to-end system development, including actuator architecture, high-voltage drive electronics, analytical and numerical modeling, and experimental validation of performance.
